# Corona_Dashboard
In this COVID-19 spread analysis project, we have seen how to build a dashboard using flask and python folium. In this dashboard, we are visualizing the region-wise effect of coronavirus. The table in the left panel shows the total active cases till date in the respective region. In the right panel, we have integrated a world map and represent the impact of the virus using a red circle. More the number of cases in the region on the map, the bigger is the red circle in that region. To integrate world map and red circles we make use of the python folium library.
